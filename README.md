# Bruh-JA-board
Our project is a deliberately useless yet uniquely entertaining Ouija board experience, where every question is met with an absurd, unexpected Malayalam troll response. Combining humor with critical thinking, it invites players to enjoy the irony of seeking “answers” that have no purpose, making it a fun, clever celebration of pointlessness!
